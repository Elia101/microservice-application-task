Spring Boot Microservice with REST APIs
This Spring Boot microservice provides four REST APIs for data manipulation in a database using JPA. 
The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on a table with the following schema:

id: A numeric auto-incrementing field.
title: A string field.
date1: A timestamp field.
qty: A numeric field.

APIs
GET /v1/data/{id}:
Reads a single line from the database using the id passed as a path parameter.

POST /v1/data:
Inserts a line into the database using the payload passed in the request body.

PUT /v1/data/{id}:
Updates a line in the database using the id passed as a path parameter and the payload.

DELETE /v1/data/{id}:
Deletes a line from the database using the id passed as a path parameter.

Database Table Creation
To create the required table in the database, use the following SQL script:

CREATE TABLE item (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  date1 TIMESTAMP,
  qty INT CHECK (qty > 0)
);

API Documentation
This application is documented using OpenAPI/Swagger to provide a detailed specification of the REST APIs and data structures used. The Swagger UI documentation can be accessed by running the application and navigating to the following URL:

Data Validation

Specifically, the title field is mandatory, and the qty field must have a value greater than 0.
